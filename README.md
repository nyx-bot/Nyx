# Nyx Rewrite

This is the codebase for the rewrite of Nyx, written with ~~Eris~~ Oceanic.js and a lot of energy drinks.

**THIS CODE IS BASICALLY A MIXTURE OF MY CURRENT KNOWLEDGE IN JAVASCRIPT AND MY KNOWLEDGE YEARS BACK. IT'S A MESS. THAT'S WHY NYX V3 IS IN DEVELOPMENT, I ONLY OPEN-SOURCED THIS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND POTENTIALLY IF PEOPLE WANTED TO SELF-HOST THEIR OWN INSTANCES.**

## Setup

1) Copy `config.example.json` into `config.json` and edit accordingly.
2) Install packages with `npm install`.
3) Run index.js with your favorite Node.js process manager.

Personally, I'd use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to manage the instance. Nyx also fully supports their web dashboard placeholders thing or whatever it's called.
